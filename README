**Tile Compare** is a simple interface for comparing tilesets.  By
providing a view into all tile sets at once, it becomes easier
to understand the difference.

Currently, it shows tiles from Google, Bing, Yahoo, and 
OpenStreetMap, with the ability to switch to their
Satellite imagery as well.


## Install
